First part of building a stack-based virtual machine. Develop a basic VM translator (similar to Java's JVM), designed to translate VM files into machine assembly language files the Hack hardware platform can understand. The next module will extend this basic translator to a full-scale VM implementation, which will then be the backend module of the two-tier compiler developed later.
### Key Concepts
